<blockquote cite="https://www.brainyquote.com/authors/ayn-rand-quotes">

Achievement of your happiness is the only moral purpose of your life, and that happiness, not pain or mindless self-indulgence, is the proof of your moral integrity, since it is the proof and the result of your loyalty to the achievement of your values. 
  - Ayn Rand
