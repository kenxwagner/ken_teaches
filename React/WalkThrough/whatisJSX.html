     What is JSX?

In the previous module we used the following code to show an output using React:
ReactDOM.render(
  <h1>Hello, React!</h1>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
React does not require using JSX, but it helps with controlling content. 
JSX is read only. This helps reduce debugging if less items are able to change content.
